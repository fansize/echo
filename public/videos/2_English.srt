1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,089
Some people
are just natural-born worriers.

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:09,510
My mother, for example,
could whip herself into a frenzy,

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:12,387
even if/ were sitting on my bed
doing nothing.

4
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,556
Shelly?

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,853
Shelly?

6
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,314
Everything okay?

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,900
Hunky-dory. Why?

8
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:28,487
Well, you're kind of dressed like
you kidnapped yourself.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,365
Oh, I'm trying to block out sensory input.

10
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,743
I hit a roadblock determining
whether virtual particles have a fixed mass

11
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,870
or violate momentum conservation.

12
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,206
But then I remembered
that Nikola Tesla believed

13
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,792
that isolation is where ideas are born.

14
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,544
Who's Nikola Tesla?

15
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:48,090
One of the most prolific scientists
of the 20th century.

16
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,508
Okay.

17
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,218
And...

18
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,305
Just out of curiosity, how isolated was he?

19
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,306
Oh, highly.

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,725
He found human contact revolting.

21
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,480
Well, that's kind of a lonely way to live,
don't you think?

22
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,816
Well, he wasn't entirely alone.

23
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,945
At the end of his life, he became
good friends with a brown pigeon.

24
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,033
See you.

25
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,374
J“ nobody else is stronger than I am j“

26
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,085
j“ yesterday I moved a mountain j“

27
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,421
j“ I bet I could be your hero j“

28
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,215
j“ I am a mighty little man j“

29
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,344
j“ I am a mighty little man j“

30
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,933
have you heard from Dr. Sturgis at all?

31
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,310
Nope.

32
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:45,272
Can you believe the hospital's
still holding him for observation?

33
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,231
Can't you?

34
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,315
Well...

35
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,526
I think I just felt a neutrino.

36
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,529
That one went right through my pants.

37
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,905
You have goosegrass!

38
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,618
And you can't have a nice lawn
if you have goosegrass.

39
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,412
I mean...

40
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,749
I'm worried about him.
I don't know how serious this is.

41
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:09,546
The whole year you were together,
did you see any, um...

42
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,006
Warning signs?

43
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,759
No. Not really.

44
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:19,139
I just thought he was another, you know,
cute, quirky egghead like Sheldon.

45
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,225
Speaking of which,

46
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,729
when are you gonna tell Sheldon
the truth about John?

47
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,356
Mm. When the time is right.

48
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,608
So he still thinks he's being treated
for mono?

49
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,612
I had to come up with something
contagious so he wouldn't want to visit.

50
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,571
Smart.

51
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,281
Thank you.

52
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,659
You're good at lying.
You should do it more often.

53
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,495
I like your earrings.

54
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,082
Oh, my, he's gonna be trapped!

55
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,543
All right, see, when you get tackled
in your own end zone,

56
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:52,381
the other team gets two points
and the ball. That's called a safety.

57
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,383
I thought one of the players was a safety.

58
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,843
Well, that's true too.

59
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,303
I'm confused.

60
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,431
Now you know how I feel when you talk
about teenage mutant ninja turtles.

61
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,849
What's confusing?

62
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,143
Everything you need
to know is in the title.

63
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,855
Dad, how would you like to be rich?

64
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,023
Go away.

65
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,983
Aren't you even a little curious?

66
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,610
Does it involve me giving you money?

67
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,655
Yeah, but then I give you more money back.

68
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,739
How much more?

69
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:18,740
Way more.

70
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,284
You gotta get in on this.

71
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,703
Thanks. I'm not interested.

72
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,913
You're gonna regret it.

73
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:25,996
Show me.

74
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,167
Texas snow globes.

75
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,460
Ooh...

76
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,588
The card store on magnolia
is going out of business.

77
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,425
They're selling these for $1 each.

78
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,261
I sell them for 5 and the money rolls in.

79
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:43,390
Does it worry you that the store selling
these things is going out of business?

80
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,100
You have no vision.

81
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,727
- Can I get back to the game?
- Fine.

82
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,437
I don't need your money. I have my own.

83
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,524
- So why are we having this conversation?
- I'd rather lose your money than mine.

84
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:54,901
Vision.

85
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,782
I've always felt
the world of subatomic particles

86
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,160
would make an excellent video game.

87
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,164
Fortunately, thanks to my brain,
I've been playing it for years.

88
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:12,043
You cheeky little muon,
you know you don't belong there.

89
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,714
Don't look at me. He's your kid.

90
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,367
Someone likes snow globes.

91
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,203
I hope so. I don't want them.

92
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

93
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,710
What do we got here?

94
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,338
Farmhouse kitchen...

95
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,592
Garfield hangs out...

96
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,807
The complete guide
to your child's mental...

97
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,351
Oh, look, that cute little book light,
I'll get that too.

98
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,477
Okay.

99
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,732
You still want the crazy kid book, right?

100
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:25,242
Okay, 52 Texas snow globes

101
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,662
comes to $55.25.

102
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,665
- Can't you do any better?
- What do you mean?

103
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,918
You're going out of business
and I'm buying them all. Give me a break.

104
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,628
Okay, $50.

105
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:38,922
-Thirty -forty.

106
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,340
- Thirty-five.
- Deal.

107
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,842
No, wait, 32.

108
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,803
Thirty-three.

109
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,180
Thirty-five.

110
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:54,812
George.

111
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,525
Hey, that's clever.

112
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,652
I'm reading this book
about mental problems,

113
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,487
and I'm worried it sounds like Sheldon.

114
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,739
Well, stop reading the book.

115
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:08,952
Shelly and Dr. Sturgis have a lot
in common, and look what happened.

116
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,162
What, you mean like how he went to...

117
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,831
As a society,

118
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,084
we've made strides
in how we discuss psychological issues.

119
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:20,005
Thirty years ago in east Texas,
let's just say we hadn't.

120
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,757
Cuckoo, cuckoo! Heh, heh.

121
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,510
Hey. That could be your son one day.

122
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:30,682
Just because they're both super-smart
doesn't mean that they're the same person.

123
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,811
I mean, sturgis was in love with your mom,
so clearly he was nuts from the get-go.

124
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,812
You're not helping.

125
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,272
I'm not wrong, either.

126
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,355
Love you.

127
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,200
Why aren't you also driving missy
to school?

128
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,328
I thought it might be nice for us to chat.

129
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,122
About missy? She is a bit much, isn't she?

130
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,334
Here's a question for you:

131
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,296
Do you ever see or hear things
that other people can't?

132
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,547
Oh, all the time.

133
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,507
Right now, the car antenna is vibrating

134
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,510
at the same frequency
as the pistons in the motor.

135
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,347
It's quite irritating, but you know me,
I don't complain.

136
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,351
I meant more like things
that aren't actually there.

137
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:19,147
Ah. Isn't that the fundamental question
of modern metaphysics?

138
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,775
What is actually there?

139
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,445
This is fun.
Missy should ride with dad more often.

140
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,697
Let me try this a different way.

141
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,743
Do you ever feel paranoid,
like people are out to get you?

142
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,955
I'm a 10-year-old in high school.
People are out to get me.

143
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,623
That's fair.

144
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:41,294
I just think if I was having these
feelings, that might be scary, right?

145
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,755
I suppose so.

146
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,008
And this is something
that's been concerning you?

147
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,385
Maybe.

148
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,011
Lately.

149
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:54,015
A little. But the important thing is
that we can always talk about

150
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,017
this kind of thing with each other.

151
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,479
Do you have any books on mental health?

152
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,605
Sure. Why?

153
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,899
I believe my mother is unraveling.

154
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:14,494
We have a few books on mental illness
you might find helpful.

155
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,373
This one's a good place to start.

156
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,875
- Have you read it?
- Read it, lived it,

157
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,170
made the mistake of talking about it
on a date.

158
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,969
Sure. Walk away.

159
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,429
They all do.

160
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,899
Who is it?

161
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,444
- Georgie Cooper.
- Who?

162
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,571
- I'm your neighbor.
- The one with the chickens?

163
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,366
The ones with that weird, smart kid?

164
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,035
Yeah, that's my brother.

165
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,414
Neither do I, sir.

166
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,498
What do you want?

167
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,876
I was wondering if you'd like to buy
one of...

168
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,963
You didn't even see what I was selling.

169
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:07,922
What?

170
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,175
Texas snow globes.

171
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,010
Dang it.

172
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,555
It's pretty.

173
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,932
Why would I want that?

174
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,016
Well, um...

175
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:24,522
Because it's Texas
and everybody in Texas loves Texas?

176
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,401
Dang it.

177
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,948
And if you act now, you can have
this beautiful, limited edition keepsake

178
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:38,244
in your home for the low, low price
of only $5.

179
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,204
I hope you know

180
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,040
- I'm missing people's court right now.
- But with Christmas coming,

181
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,042
this would make
an excellent stocking-stuffer.

182
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,002
Well, you're my grandson

183
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,879
and I love you.

184
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,839
So it hurts me to do this.

185
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,675
Dang it.

186
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,765
Oh!

187
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,476
Oh, dear.

188
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,352
Oh, no.

189
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,855
Oh, no.

190
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,192
Oh, dear.

191
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,163
Sorry I gave you the boot before.

192
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,624
- Does that mean you'll buy one now?
- No.

193
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,501
You didn't sell a single snow globe?

194
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,880
Don't give your brother a hard time.
He took some initiative and I admire that.

195
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,007
- Thank you.
- I mean, the snow globes were silly,

196
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,594
- but I bet your next idea will be great.
- They're not silly.

197
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,514
I'm glad you feel that way,
because you got 50 of them.

198
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,058
I'm gonna sell them all
just to prove you wrong.

199
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:46,896
Well, now I know it's a peeing contest
between you and your daddy, I'll take two.

200
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,567
Well, all right. Mom, you're not crazy
about dad. Wanna buy a snow globe?

201
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,734
Enough.

202
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,612
And I don't like us
making fun of each other.

203
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:59,200
We're family, and this should be a place that
is safe, where we can talk about anything.

204
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,326
I agree.

205
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,246
Now, let's just say grace.

206
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,671
Thank you, god,
for this food we are about to receive,

207
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,382
and bless the hands that prepared it.
And please,

208
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,928
keep us all in good health, body, and mind.

209
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,098
- Why are you looking at me?
- I'm not. Amen.

210
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,725
Amen.

211
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,819
Hello?

212
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,656
Oh, baby.

213
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,783
What are you doing up?

214
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,703
I couldn't sleep. Why are you up?

215
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,246
Same.

216
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,916
Do you have insomnia from anxiety?

217
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,334
Is that what you have?

218
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,672
What are you anxious about?

219
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,384
Honestly, your mental health.

220
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,886
Me? Why?

221
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,722
Well, you seem preoccupied lately,

222
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,725
and you were asking me
all those questions in the car.

223
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,604
I was just letting you know
that if you were having any problems,

224
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,522
you can come to me with them.

225
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,983
You think I have mental problems?

226
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,278
Well, not problems.

227
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,197
I'm just worried about your future,

228
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,744
and when I see you moving subatomic
particles around in the air, that...

229
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,996
Subatomic particles are real.

230
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:32,877
You talk to an invisible man in the sky who
grants wishes. If anyone's mental, it's you.

231
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,173
Okay, now you are over the line.
You apologize.

232
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,551
What the hell's going on?

233
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:43,805
- Nothing, it's fine.
- Mom thinks that I'm crazy.

234
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,268
I thought we weren't
supposed to say stuff like that.

235
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,821
- Mother.
- Yes?

236
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,365
Is it okay if I use a
knife to butter my toast

237
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,702
or are you worried
I'll do something crazy with it?

238
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,745
You can butter your own toast.

239
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,040
Oh, good, you see the toast too.
I was afraid I was imagining it.

240
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,543
- Sheldon.
- All right, that's enough.

241
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,588
- What's going on?
- Nothing, everything's fine.

242
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:18,881
I'll tell you later.

243
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,134
My mother believes I'm mentally unstable.

244
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:26,097
And since there's a genetic component
and I'm her child, I suppose it's possible.

245
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,809
I know you're angry right now,
but you will not be disrespectful.

246
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,645
You know, fits of rage
are a classic sign of psychosis.

247
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,981
Oh, you haven't seen fits of rage yet.

248
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,693
I said that's enough.
Both of y'all are acting like lunatics.

249
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,446
- You up to speed?
- I think I got it.

250
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,504
I already accepted Jesus in my heart.

251
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,174
No, I'm selling these Texas snow globes.

252
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,884
I have enough crap in my house.

253
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:03,967
Crap?

254
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,763
You love Texas, right?

255
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,847
Well, sure.

256
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,724
And who doesn't like snow?

257
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,393
Sleds and snowball fights.

258
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,982
I remember it snowed hard here
once when I was a kid.

259
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,610
- That must've been amazing.
- It was.

260
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,238
They canceled school. Me and my brother
build a snow fort in the backyard.

261
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,615
That's cool.

262
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,867
My brother and I love doing stuff together.

263
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,619
We're really close.

264
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:34,165
I hadn't thought about that day
in a long time.

265
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,876
Well, what if that memory...

266
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,379
Was just one shake away?

267
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,215
- How much?
- Five dollars.

268
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,343
Fine. I'll take it.

269
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,431
- How about you get one for your brother?
- I don't know.

270
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,683
He married some yankee gal,
moved to Connecticut.

271
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,685
But he's still your brother.

272
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,439
Oh, what the hell.
She's gonna leave him at some point.

273
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,282
I don't see the point of this.

274
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,952
I just don't think it could hurt
for us to talk to someone.

275
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,621
But I could be at home right now
wearing a blindfold, mittens,

276
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,415
and nose plug doing something important.

277
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:19,043
You know, maybe you should mention
the blindfold and mittens to the doctor.

278
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,671
Or maybe I'll mention how you think that
god speaks to you,

279
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,214
because I find that concerning.

280
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,675
He does speak to me,
and right now he's saying

281
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,969
I should wash your mouth out with soap.

282
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,054
Violent fantasies.

283
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,138
Interesting.

284
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:37,562
J“ salesman, where you gonna go sell
all of your goods today... j“

285
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:41,732
Mrs. Ebner, do you remember where you
were the last time it snowed in medford?

286
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,610
We didn't have a carrot
for the snowman's nose,

287
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,529
so can you believe we used a hot dog?

288
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,698
That must've been a sight.

289
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,533
I was with my grandchildren.

290
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,535
They had never seen snow before.

291
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,662
I taught them to make snow angels.

292
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,165
Little angels making little angels.

293
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,959
Can't put a price on memories.

294
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,920
- But I am running a special. Two for 8.
- Hm...

295
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:07,049
Hey, little Princess.
This is called "snow."

296
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,133
She likes it.

297
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,232
So naturally,
I was concerned about his well-being,

298
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,735
and was keeping an eye on him
just to be safe.

299
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,779
- It's called being neurotic.
- It's called being a good mother.

300
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,908
This is healthy.
Communication is the cornerstone...

301
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,910
I'm behaving no differently than ever.

302
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,787
Why are you suddenly so worried
about me?

303
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,498
That is a valid question.

304
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,833
Has anything changed recently?

305
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,211
- Well...
- Maybe it's hormonal.

306
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,296
When does menopause typically begin?

307
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,798
It is not my hormones.

308
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,302
Well, it certainly isn't mine.
I'm showing no signs of puberty.

309
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,599
You know, sometimes mothers
look for issues with their children

310
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,685
- so they can feel more needed.
- Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

311
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,479
That is not what's happening.

312
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,147
Well, then what is happening?

313
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,615
Baby, there's something I need to tell you.

314
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:19,914
Dr. Sturgis is not in the kind of hospital
you think he is.

315
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,999
What kind of hospital is he in?

316
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,712
The psychiatric kind.

317
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,841
- Why, what's going on?
- He was having some issues,

318
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:34,929
but he's getting the help he needs,
and I'm sure he's gonna be fine.

319
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:41,227
And you think since he and I are
both gifted, I'm going to end up like him.

320
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,438
Well, it...

321
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,941
It crossed my mind.

322
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:55,408
Sheldon, you're my baby.
It is my job to worry about you.

323
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,784
I can't help it.

324
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,997
I'm sorry I caused you so much concern.

325
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,376
I'm not.

326
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,716
See how valuable
a little communication can be?

327
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,676
You do not take credit for this.

328
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:30,443
And the turtle eating
the pizza is Leonardo.

329
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,736
How can you tell?

330
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,404
He's wearing blue.

331
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:39,994
Dad, remember my silly idea?

332
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,664
Guess what? It's snowing.
